# Content Automation Single Part Shorts (CASPS)

"Content Automation Single Part Shorts" (CASPS) is a tool for creating a single part short MP4s from reddit posts. This version (CASPS) focuses on shorter posts/stories without sequel parts. This is the original version, which the others are derived from. The whole process from creating the MP4 to uploading the video is automated with Python, Selenium and many other libraries. In addition to English, this will be available in other languages and non-English subreddits.
