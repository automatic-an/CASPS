**Automation of the creation and uploading process of youtube shorts. Doesn't work after the Reddit API changes. Now needs fixes to work; like changing the charged API usage to the scraping of the Reddit threads. Part of the video creation code is originally inspired by Lewis Menelaws (credits), but most of the code is heavily modified and the uploding automation is completely implemented by me (selenium and undetected undetected chromium parts). I also implemented many new features, like custom voices with text to speech and profanity filter for the content. NOTE that the .env is included on purpose so that you can see the setting options and the best configuration. (This project was done only for personal research efforts, not for monetary purposes, and any breakings of the youtube guidelines are at one's own risk)**


# Main Line

# Content Automation Single Part Shorts (CASPS)

"Content Automation Single Part Shorts" (CASPS) is a tool for creating a single part short MP4s from reddit posts. This version (CASPS) focuses on shorter posts/stories without sequel parts. This is the original version, which the others are derived from. The whole process from creating the MP4 to uploading the video is automated with Python, Selenium and many other libraries. In addition to English, this will be available in other languages and non-English subreddits.
